			<h1>Troubleshooting and Known Issues</h1>
			<p><a class="button" href="/converter">Back to Converter Page</a>
			<br>
			<br>If you are having problems with the converter, please read the following list of common issues and known problems. If you still can't figure it out, feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>. I will be happy to help!</p>
			<br>
			<h2>The Converter Requires Flash</h2>
			<p><a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer">Adobe Flash</a> is required to use both the online and downloaded versions of the converter. It is also required to run the converted projects. Many browsers today block Flash by default, so you may need to allow it for this website specifically. Also, since Flash is gradually being phased out, you may also want to <a href="/converter/executables">convert</a> your SWF files to applications for easier sharing.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Cannot Convert SB3 Files</h2>
			<p>Scratch has been completely rewritten in the latest version. Scratch 3 files are totally incompatible with Scratch 2, and therefore with this converter. Try out my <a href="/converter3alpha">Scratch 3 converter</a>!</p>
			<br>
			<h2>SWF File Extension Needed</h2>
			<p>Like any other file type, a SWF needs to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename_extension">named correctly</a> for your computer to know how to open it. Make sure you save the output file ending in ".swf" or it may not open properly.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Can't Save in Incognito Mode</h2>
			<p>In Google Chrome, Flash silently fails to save files if you're in incognito mode. (Specifically, the AS3 function <a href="https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/net/FileReference.html#save()">FileReference.save()</a> fires a <b>COMPLETE</b> event but does not write the file.) Use the converter in a regular window or a different browser.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Forced 4:3 Aspect Ratio</h2>
			<p>Scratch is designed with dimensions of 480x360 pixels. Converted projects <i>must</i> be in the same 4:3 ratio, or black bars will appear on either side of the window. This cannot easily be changed without using a custom version of Scratch. (By request, I have previously built a converter based on <a href="https://github.com/nick-edens/hacknscratch">hacknscratch</a>, which is in a 16:9 ratio. <a href="/contact">Contact me</a> if you are interested.)</a></p>
			<br>
			<h2>Security Restrictions in Flash Player 23</h2>
			<p>There are additional security restrictions in Flash Player 23 and onwards. More details are available in the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/flash-player/release-note/fp_23_air_23_release_notes.html">release notes</a>, but they essentially prevent locally saved SWF files from being able to use some <a href="https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/display/Loader.html">Loader</a> functions that Scratch needs. (Specifically, they disable <b>local-with-filesystem</b> privileges.) This is impossible for me to bypass. However, this restriction does not apply to SWFs that are <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_embed_src.asp">embedded</a> on a website, <a href="/converter/executables">converted</a> to an application, or run in a standalone Flash Player.</p>
