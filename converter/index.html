			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Have you ever wanted to share your Scratch project outside the official website? Well, now you can. This tool converts Scratch 1.4 (SB) and Scratch 2.0 (SB2) files to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Adobe Flash</a> SWF files. Anybody with a Flash Player can view them, and they can even be <a href="/converter/executables">converted</a> into applications for many operating systems.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Use the Converter</h2>
			<p>If you have a <a href="https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">Flash Player</a> enabled in your browser, you can use the <a href="/converter/online">online converter</a>. Otherwise, you will have to <a href="/converter/download">download</a> a copy (includes the source code).</p>
			<br>
			<h2>How it Works</h2>
			<p>Regularly, Scratch 2.0 projects are run by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript#ActionScript_3.0">ActionScript 3</a> code in the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/download/scratch2">Offline Editor</a> or the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">website</a>. When you convert a project to a SWF, it's packaged along with a copy of that code. A custom main <a href="https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/Class.html">class</a> is used to read the included Scratch project and settings file. It starts the built-in editor and applies the various settings. (This can include auto-starting the project, turning on Turbo Mode, and hiding certain UI elements.)</p>

			<h2>License</h2>
			<p>Scratch is open source and is distributed under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt">GPL v2</a> license. As explained in detail <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">here</a>, this requires any derived work to use the same license and share its source code as well. You can find the source code for the converter <a href="/converter/download">here</a> and the code for Scratch <a href="https://github.com/LLK/scratch-flash/">here</a>. You are free to use this code for whatever you want, but you must share your code too.
			<br>
			<br>Additionally, I was asked by the Scratch Team to include the following message:</p>
			<pre>Scratch is developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. See http://scratch.mit.edu.</pre>
			<br>
			<h2>Resources</h2>
			<p>These applications and websites were invaluable to me when programming this converter:
			<br>• <a href="https://github.com/LLK/scratch-flash/">Scratch source code</a>
			<br>• <a href="https://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html">Adobe Flex SDK 4.6</a>
			<br>• <a href="https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/swf-file-format-spec.pdf">SWF file format specification</a>

			<br>• <a href="https://www.free-decompiler.com/flash/">FFDec free Flash decompiler</a>
			<br>Also, thanks to millions of posts on ActionScript tutorial and forum websites, especially <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

			<h2>Example</h2>
			<p>An example of a Scratch project converted with this tool is my game <a href="/simplicity">Simplicity</a>. Can you even tell it's not a native Flash game?</p>
