			<br>I wrote this <a href="https://getbitbar.com/">BitBar</a> plugin a few years ago. It's a simple, reliable script to monitor your Mac's uptime. It also saves your best time so you can brag about how stable your machine is.
			<br>
			<br>You need <a href="https://getbitbar.com/">BitBar</a> to use this. Install this script by copying it to your plugins folder. Enjoy!
			<br>
			<br>When removing this script, you may want to delete the saved file here:</p>
